Description: The CellScore Standard Dataset contains expression data from a
 wide variety of human cells and tissues, which should be used as standard
 cell types in the calculation of the CellScore. All data was curated from 
 public databases such as Gene Expression Omnibus (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) or 
 ArrayExpress (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/). This standard dataset only 
 contains data from the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0
 microarrays. Samples were manually annotated using the database information or
 consulting the publications in which the datasets originated. The sample 
 annotations are stored in the phenoData slot of the expressionSet object. 
 Raw data (CEL files) were processed with the affy package to generate 
 present/absent calls (mas5calls) and background-subtracted values, which were
 then normalized by the R-package yugene to yield the final expression values 
 for the standard expression matrix. The annotation table for the microarray
 was retrieved from the BioC annotation package hgu133plus2. All data are stored
 in an expressionSet object.
